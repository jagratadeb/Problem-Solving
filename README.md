# 🧠 Personal Coding Journal

Welcome to my algorithmic practice repository — a personal space to document problem-solving journeys, revisit patterns, and refine logic through consistent effort.  
All solutions are written in **C** and **C++**, with a strong emphasis on clarity, modularity, and edge case handling.

## 📂 Platform Index

This section serves as a centralized redirector to platform-specific folders and their respective documentation.  
Each entry links directly to the internal `README.md` file for that platform, which contains detailed breakdowns of problem categories, solution formats, and progress tracking.

### 🧭 Navigation Table

## 📒 Philosophy

This repository is a **personal journal**, not a collaborative project.  
**Contributions are not accepted.**

Goals:
- Build a consistent habit of solving problems  
- Document learnings, edge cases, and approaches  
- Maintain a clean, modular structure for future reference

## 📌 Notes

- Each solution is self-contained and named for clarity  
- Internal `README.md` files may be added to platform folders over time
